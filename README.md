# Hello there ðŸ‘‹, and welcome to my profile!

#### Let me introduce myself :

   My name is Yeheizkiel Gabriel, and I'am 19 years old. Currently I'm working as a Website Developer in one of startup industries in Surabaya, and now I work from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic virus.
  
   I can speak in more than 5 languages: Javanese, Indonesian, Malay, English, Arabic, and Japanese. I love learning foreign languages, especially Japanese. As a side-work, I have joined & contributing an open source project regarding database of information on animation shows from various countries and sites, called [Ryuuganime](https://github.com/ryuuganime), which is owned by [Nattadasu](https://github.com/nattadasu).
